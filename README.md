# Angular exercise

* Creating a SPA application using something like angular, highcharts, requirejs, LESS/SASS
* Create a menu that has a link to the home page and to a page describing your application and how to get it running
* The home page should display a number of charts (4+ depending upon your chart size and layout)
* You should be able to expand the charts to display a larger version (either lightbox-like thing or on a new page)
* The data for the charts should be loaded from something like a JSON resource. Persistence isn't expected for the data.
* You should be able to alter something simple about the charts, such as the chart type or the chart name
